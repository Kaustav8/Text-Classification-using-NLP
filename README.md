# Text-Classification-using-NLP
This is a real-world example of text classification. I have trained a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a given movie review is positive or negative. This is a classic example of sentimental analysis where people's sentiments towards a particular entity are classified into different categories.

The dataset that I have used for this project can be downloaded from the Cornell Natural Language Processing Group. The dataset consists of a total of 2000 documents. Half of the documents contain positive reviews regarding a movie while the remaining half contains negative reviews. Further details regarding the dataset can be found at this link: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/

Unzip or extract the dataset once you download it. Open the folder "txt_sentoken". The folder contains two subfolders: "neg" and "pos". If you open these folders, you can see the text documents containing movie reviews.
